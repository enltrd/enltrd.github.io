# Recharge Room

So you want to contribute to global domination by taking part in a Recharge Room? Great! This document describe the steps you need to complete to do just that.

## Before the event

1. Register with Niantic. All recharging agents must officially register for the anomaly at https://www.ingress.com/events
	- Everyone must register as remote/offsite, not onsite or supporter kit only.
	- At minimum, RR agents must register for a FREE ticket. Agents who purchase a paid swag pack must designate another agent who will attend the anomaly in person and pick up.
	- No Niantic registration, NO BADGE
2. Register with ROCKS. All recharging agents must also register as "remote recharge" on enlrocks: https://enlightened.rocks/szczecin2017
3. Log your details with the RR captain: agent name, level, and ticket number (long string below the QR code)
4. Ensure you meet the target criteria for badges. This includes time availability and transportation to attend your room/event for the duration of the anomaly, as well as the gear, level, and attention span to be an effective recharger.

Check Levels: Szczecin is xxx km from Trondheim, requiring level XX to recharge

Get gear: 200-300 PC8 or equivalent in Lawson

Plan for a full day event; 5-6 hours on 2017-08-26 starting as early as 11:30 and ending as late as 18:30. Agents must be on time and present for the duration of the anomaly.

## On the day

Ensure all agents are present at the designated location.

Ensure all agents are Comm silent and do not upgrade/frack portals within range. Resistance response to an ENL farm may disrupt key exchange efforts and otherwise be a distraction. You don't want RES stealing your capsules as you are trying to distribute them.

Exchange all necessary PC8.

Have all agents provide screenshots of starting all-time XML recharged and record in the RR Registration Sheet. Screenshots should include both the stats AND the agent's name, and also need to be uploaded into a shared drive for RR verification.

Make sure every agent has received his/her capsule of keys. Make sure you are in communication with your operator.

Work with the RR operator to receive information about high-priority portals your team may have. This will likely include ENL target portals (obvious in scanner because of the green rings around the portal), shard manifestation portals (will have a floating rock on top of them and a shard number shown in the corner of the portal image), cluster portals (colored hexagon rings) and other portals of strategic significance.

Make clear to agents that the nature of a shard/hybrid game is that no portal is guaranteed to be out of play until the anomaly ends. Do not recycle any keys until the anomaly is over

Make sure agents have at least one designated capsule in which they can store anomaly keys that are not actively being used. All other non-anomaly keys must be in capsules or lockers.

Make clear to agents that they MUST NOT RECHARGE any green portals unless specified by the operator and you as a captain. It is especially important that we not recharge random green portals with links off of them, no matter how high their level or how nice the shields are on them. Agents will need to pay close attention to instructions during the anomaly since portal statuses will change constantly. A portal that neede to be recharged at 13:39 may need to be left to die at 13:48

Rechargers should use 'boost recharge all' on each specified portal.

## At the end of the anomaly

1. Take a team photograph if possible
2. Have all agents provide screenshots of ending all-time XM recharged, record in the RR Registration Comp Input Sheet
